# Research Notes

This folder collects deeper dives and working notes used to ground the solution reviews in evidence.

- `research/livepeer-delegator-incentives.md`: tokenomics/program design ideas + constraints.
- `research/livepeer-delegator-outflows-research.md`: on-chain outflow + sybil-cashout hypothesis research.

These are imported from the main workspace repo and should eventually be edited/maintained here.

## Notes

- `Unbond` is not a clean exit; stake can later be rebonded.
- `WithdrawStake` is a cashout of unlocked stake and can include principal + rewards.
- `Claimed rewards` is denominated in LPT; `Claimed fees` is denominated in ETH.
- `Withdraw/rewards` > 100% typically indicates the wallet withdrew principal in addition to any earned stake.

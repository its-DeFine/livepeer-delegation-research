# Research Notes

This folder collects deeper dives and working notes used to ground the solution reviews in evidence.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Outflows + retention" href="/research/livepeer-delegator-outflows-research">
    Delegation exits, dormancy proxies, retention curves, and post-withdraw destination classification.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Incentives + tokenomics" href="/research/livepeer-delegator-incentives">
    Design patterns to grow small delegators without enabling easy sybil farming.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

- `research/livepeer-delegator-incentives.md`: tokenomics/program design ideas + constraints.
- `research/livepeer-delegator-outflows-research.md`: on-chain outflow + sybil-cashout hypothesis research.

These were imported from the main workspace repo and should be edited/maintained here going forward.

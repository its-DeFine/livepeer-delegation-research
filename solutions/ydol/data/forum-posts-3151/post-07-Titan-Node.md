b3nnn:


Savings to participants are substantial at approx. $1500 in slippage reduction on a $25,000 sale of LPT (estimate based on data below).


While I understand that more liquidity can benefit larger single transactions, the table does not account for CEX arbitrage bots that re balance the pool after every swap.


From what I see on-chain, even small $500 swaps often trigger Binance bots to re balance the pool within seconds.


I would argue the slippage on $25,000 swap made in $1,000 - $2,000 increments would be minimal or mostly static.


Of course this introduces a whole other argument that requires incremental sells (which is annoying) but overall not sure how impactful more liquidity is considering the trade offs, risk and sell pressure to add the liquidity.


just my 2 cents

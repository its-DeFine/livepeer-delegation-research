I agree with
@Titan-Node
here.  From my understanding the amount of sell pressure this would create could cause a substantial drop in the price of the token. If providing liquidity is your goal to be more appealing to investors, the initial drop might do the opposite and especially now with the token price being low.


As an operator and investor in the protocol this makes me very uncomfortable.


My view is that this seems to be focusing on a problem that isn’t the most prominent problem we should be solving. From the original proposal it states ‘attract top builders’ and ‘improved builder onboarding’. Is driving more demand to the network not the area we should be focusing resources on instead?


Apologies if I am not understanding this correctly, these are just my thoughts.


@b3nnn
I think you were also saying in the Watercooler that for new SPE proposals, coin issuance to be graduated over time based on milestones achieved and merit (apologies if I have that wrong or it was someone else : ) ). Therefore asking for 250,000 LPT in one go in a 2/3 multisig for custody is an enormous ask which requires a huge amount of trust.

One last point to add..


ChaseMedia:


Therefore asking for 250,000 LPT in one go in a 2/3 multisig for custody is an enormous ask which requires a huge amount of trust.


The trust here is secured onchain.. the multisig provides secure custody and can withdraw funds from the vault and return them to the treasury at any time.


But I also understand that 250,000 LPT is a big ask relevant to the current size of the treasury.  While this is a major priority, I think people may be more willing to consider this proposal on its merits when rewards to the treasury are turned back on.  So it would be great to get some signal on this.. please let me know what you think:


Move this to a proposal now


Wait for LIP101 to restart treasury rewards first

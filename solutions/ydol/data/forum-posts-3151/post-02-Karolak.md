regarding the Arrakis performance fee:
50% of the trading fees the vault generates
— does that also mean they’ll cover 50% of any losses? What about MEV or sandwich attacks? Who absorbs that risk?


A 50/50 split also implies that roughly
125k LPT would need to be dumped and swapped to ETH
. How is that going to be executed — TWAP, market order, limit order? at what price? What happens to the earnings afterward? Will they be recycled back into the pool or extracted to the treasury?


Overall, I like the idea. The flexibility to withdraw assets at any time if a larger treasury request comes up is useful. And it’s good that the treasury funds can finally be put to work instead of just sitting idle.

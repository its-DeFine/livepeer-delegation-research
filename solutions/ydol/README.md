# YDOL — Solution Dossier (Placeholder)

This dossier will be filled in by the parallel delegation research session.

Next:
- Add the YDOL proposal link(s)
- Decode proposal(s) on-chain (Governor ProposalCreated) + treasury flows
- Specify mechanism by which it impacts delegation (direct or indirect)
- Score it using `docs/rubric.md`

# Lisar — Delegation Onboarding Program

This section groups all Lisar-related evaluation materials.

## What Lisar is (in one sentence)

A treasury-funded, product-led program aiming to onboard new delegators (often small) by reducing friction (UX, gas, fiat rails).

## Current headline (count vs stake)

From the on-chain validated cohort in the analysis:
- Impact is **much stronger on “new delegator count”** than on **total bonded stake** (so far).

This makes it relevant if the target KPI is “# of delegator addresses”, but it is not (yet) a meaningful lever for “total bonded stake”.

## How it connects to the bracket thesis

If Livepeer’s strategy is “grow `1k–10k` and `10k+`”, Lisar-style onboarding can still be valuable — but only if the program can demonstrate:
- retention past 90/180 days, and
- **graduation** (users moving from single-digit LPT into meaningful stake brackets over time).

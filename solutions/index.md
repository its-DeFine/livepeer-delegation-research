This repo evaluates concrete proposals (and shipped products) against a consistent problem definition and rubric.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Lisar (delegation onboarding)" href="/solutions/lisar">
    Treasury-funded onboarding program; strongest on delegator count, weak (so far) on stake impact.
  </Card>
  <Card title="IDOL / Arrakis (DEX liquidity)" href="/solutions/ydol">
    Liquidity intervention; plausibly helps higher-stake entrants, but has measurement + downside risk.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Tenderize (tLPT liquid staking)" href="/solutions/tenderize">
    Historical LST: created many small stake participants, but doesn’t directly create protocol delegator accounts.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Scoreboard" href="/docs/scoreboard">
    Cross-solution comparison table and notes.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

# Scoreboard

| Solution | Status | Delegator KPI | Stake KPI | Sybil posture | Notes |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
| [Lisar](/solutions/lisar/livepeer-lisar-spe-delegation-analysis) | active | TBD | TBD | TBD | Treasury-funded delegator onboarding program |
| [IDOL / Arrakis](/solutions/ydol) | reviewed | TBD | TBD | TBD | DEX liquidity-focused proposal; measurement is the key risk |
| [Tenderize (tLPT)](/solutions/tenderize) | historical | +0 delegators (protocol) / 2,518 depositors | ~92.2k LPT deposited | pooled (sybil-neutral) | Liquid staking archetype + cautionary tale (admin/upgrade risk) |
| [Delegator tiers (stake + contribution)](/solutions/delegator-tiers) | concept | TBD | TBD | depends on proofs | Bonus/perks ladder gated by verifiable usage + contributions (runs as a program, not a protocol rewrite) |

Notes:
- “Delegator KPI” here means **protocol-level** new `BondingManager` delegators unless otherwise stated.
- Some rows are intentionally **TBD** until the dossier has explicit KPI definitions + measurement windows.

# Evaluation Rubric (How We Judge Solutions)

Score each axis 0–5. “5” means it strongly improves the axis *with credible evidence and realistic assumptions*.

## 1) Net-new delegators (count)

- Does it bring new people in, or mostly reshuffle existing delegators?
- Is the growth measurable on-chain (first-time bonders), and is the counting definition clear?

## 2) Net-new stake (amount)

- Does it bring new delegated stake to Livepeer?
- Does it rely on temporary mercenary capital that leaves immediately?

## 3) Retention / churn

- Are there explicit retention hooks (vesting, lock, delayed rewards, clawbacks)?
- What happens after the incentive window ends?

## 4) Sybil resistance / uniqueness

- What prevents “many-wallet” farming?
- If relying on identity/KYC, what’s the UX + privacy + regulatory surface?

## 5) Decentralization impact

- Does the solution push stake to many orchestrators or concentrate it?
- Are there explicit “anti-concentration” rules (caps, delegation sets)?

## 6) Implementation feasibility

- Can this ship in weeks vs quarters?
- What’s on-chain vs off-chain? Who maintains it?

## 7) Cost efficiency (treasury ROI)

- Cost per retained delegator (30/90/180d)
- Cost per net-new LPT bonded (and how it changes over time)

## 8) Safety / compliance / trust

- Custody risk (EOA vs contract wallets; key management)
- Fiat rails / KYC / AML risks (if applicable)
- Attack surface (smart contracts, incentives gaming)
